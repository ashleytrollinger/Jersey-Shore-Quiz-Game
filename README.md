# Jersey-Shore-Quiz-Game
## Description
In this challenge we were suppose to create an interactive quiz game that when played will remove time for incorrect answers and then at the end of the quiz give the player an option to save their score to the scoreboard. It took me a long time to figure this one out and the highscores page is still giving me a little trouble. Also if you click the highscore button of of the homepage it will just append the array to the homepage instead of taking the user to the whole page. If I had more time I would have created multiple html pages to make it slightly easier (if that is even possible).
