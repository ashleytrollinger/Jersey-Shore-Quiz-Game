## Description
Jersey Shore Quiz Game is an interactive quiz that challenges players on their knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. The game features a timed quiz, where players can test their skills, answering a series of multiple-choice questions. The application stores high scores, allowing players to gauge their progress compared to their peers.

Note: The high scores page is a work in progress, and clicking the high score button on the homepage appends the array to the homepage instead of navigating to the high scores page.
